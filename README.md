# Mole Patrol

Welcome to Mole Patrol! This is the beginnings of a web version of the classic arcade game whack-a-mole using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Avogadro the mole will randomly pop up in a hole and then disappear. If you can click on him fast enough you get a point but if he disappears and you click on an empty spot you lose a life. You can change how fast he moves by clicking on the desired speed at the top.
