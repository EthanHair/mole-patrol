# Mole Patrol

Welcome to Mole Patrol! This is the beginnings of a web version of the classic arcade game whack-a-mole using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Moles will randomly pop up in a hole and then disappear. If you can click on them fast enough you get a point but if they disappear and you click on an empty spot you lose a life. You can change how fast they move by clicking on the desired speed at the top. Or click on Hard-Mode for a challenge. If you can manage to catch Avogodro the golden mole, he is worth 5 points!
